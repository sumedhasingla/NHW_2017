This lesson will cover some of the basics of using the R programming
language.  If you have used other languages, such as MATLAB, this
tutorial is for you.  The main lectures include basics to get you
started and there's one extra section that we probably won't have time
to cover that includes some more advanced topics like the tidyr/dplyr
libraries, which are great for manipulating data and the fmri library,
which can be used to read NIfTI files into R.
