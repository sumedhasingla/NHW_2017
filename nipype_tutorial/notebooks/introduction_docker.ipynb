    "[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers. Those containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, system tools, software libraries, such as Python, FSL, AFNI, SPM, FreeSurfer, ANTs, etc. This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.\n",

    "<font color='red'>Important:</font> **You don't need Docker to run Nipype on your system**. For Mac and Linux users, it probably is much simpler to install Nipype directly on your system. For more information on how to do this see the [Nipype website](http://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/install.html). But for Windows user, or users that don't want to setup all the dependencies themselves, Docker is the way to go."

This docker image sets up a Linux environment on your system, with functioning Python, Nipype, FSL, AFNI, ANTs and SPM12 software package, some example data and all the tutorial notebooks to learn Nipype. Alternatively, you can also create your own docker image with [Neurodocker](https://github.com/kaczmarj/neurodocker)."

Here: ``/path/to/nipype_tutorial`` is your local directory where you downloaded [Nipype Tutorial repository](https://github.com/satra/nih-workshop-2017). ``/path/to/data/`` is a directory where you have dataset ``ds000114``, and ``/path/to/output`` can be an empty directory that will be used for output. The second part of the ``-v`` flag (here: ``/opt/tutorial``, ``/data`` or ``/output``) specifies under which path the mounted folders can be found inside the container. **Important**: To use the ``tutorial``, ``data`` and ``output`` folder, you first need to create them on your system!\n",
    "- ``satra/nih-workshop-2017:latest`` tells docker which image you want to run.\n",

    "\n",
    "   In my case, this returned ``192.168.99.100``\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you haven't already created a new folder to store your container output into, do so. You can create the folder either in the explorer as usual or do it with the command ``mkdir -p`` in the docker console. For example like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``mkdir -p /c/Users/username/output``\n",

    "    Please replace ``username`` with the name of the current user on your system. **Pay attention** that the folder paths in the docker terminal are not backslash (``\\``) as we usually have in Windows. Also, ``C:\\`` needs to be specified as ``/c/``.\n",

    "    `` docker run -it --rm -v /c/Users/username/path/to/nipype_tutorial/:/opt/tutorial -v /c/Users/username/path/to/data/:/data -v /c/Users/username/path/to/output/:/output -p 8888:8888 satra/nih-workshop-2017:latest``\n",
