    "In [Workflow notebook](basic_worflow.ipynb) you learnt about ``Workflows`` that specify processing by an execution graph and offer efficient recomputing. However, sometimes you might want to use ``Interfaces`` that gives better control of the execution of each step and can be easily combine with any Python code. Unfortunately, ``Interfaces`` do not offer any caching and you always dully recompute your task. \n",

    "Solution to this problem can be a ``caching`` mechanism supported by Nipype. Nipype caching relies on the ``Memory`` class and creates an execution context that is bound to a disk cache.\n",
